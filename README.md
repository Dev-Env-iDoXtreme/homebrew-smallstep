# Smallstep Homebrew Formulas

This repository contains `Ruby` Formulas for installing Smallstep tools via
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

## Step CLI Formula

The `step cli` formula is located at [./step.rb](./step.rb). **Do Not** update
this formula directly. We have some package management scripts to do that for
us.
